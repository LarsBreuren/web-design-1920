# Web Design @cmda-minor-web 1920

## Who is the person i'am designing for?
It's Larissa, she won several medals with cycling on the olympics. 
she is blind and uses screenreaders (JAWS) to navigate trough the web and communicate online.
She loves to horseride, read alot of books and laugh.
She is capable of using her phone and/or laptop to view data for her schedule. 
The scheme itself however is very user unfriendly to use even when you're not blind.

## Testing
No tests done yet, however we discussed some things that might be of interest when designing a website for her.
The NS website is a good example of a usable website for her. And she would like to see more details in the schedule when filtering.

## Test 15-4
Notes:
kan tekst skippen - > is fijn
combobox voor maanden selectie dropbox (kan dan tikken).
handig dat details te tabben en met pijltjes te doen zijn.

Leuk systeem
zwarte achtergrond is fijn (gevoelig voor licht).
