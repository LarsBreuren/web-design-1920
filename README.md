## installation
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Open the terminal on the docs folder
  3 Install dependencies with `npm install`
  3. Give the command `npm run dev`
  4. navigate to localhost:3000
  
  ## Design goal
  Larissa currently uses 2 schema's for her planning. 
  The yearly and week schema, both are very confusing even with sight.
  Screenreaders are not great reading those kind of documents so Larissa needs someone to help her understand these schema's.
  My goal is to make a website that she alone can use to see her schema's. 
  
  ## My solution
  I learned that Larissa likes to skip unnecessary content and go straight to headers/links.
  I've made the website so that you have specific headers with relevant content beneath them, this way Larissa can quickly go          trough the website and find what she is looking for. 
  The website asks a few question to get the content she wants, like what month? And what activity in this month? Then it shows the details she needs. Concluding from tests done with the prototype she likes the flow and headers.
  
  ## Live demo
  Feel free to give my prototype a try, since Larissa still checks her schema's with her cycling partner i've have given the layout some attention:

 ## Testing
 ### [Test 1](https://github.com/LarsBreuren/web-design-1920/wiki/Test-1)
  This day was more for getting to know each other, as group we've gathered some questions to learn about Larissa.
  And what she would like to see as final product. Questions and answers found in the wiki (click link here above).
  
 ### [Test 2](https://github.com/LarsBreuren/web-design-1920/wiki/Test-2)
  Here i had my first prototype working, Larissa liked the flow but there quite some things that could be improved, full details in link above.
  
 ### [Test 3](https://github.com/LarsBreuren/web-design-1920/wiki/Test-3)
  At this test all the feedback from the last session was processed. The flow was now very clear for her, she could find things very quickly and liked the headers. However she missed some important dates on the homepage. Full details on link above.
  
  ## Conclusion
It was very intresting designing for a single person, usually we design things that work for as much people as possible so this is quite the opposite. However very educational, it was intresting to see how Larissa goes trough the web. What i liked most was making something for just one person and having that person testing what you've made. Some small things i didn't think about made huge changes for Larissa's experience with my prototype, for example: dropdown form instead of radio buttons, the dropdown was so much faster! Really intresting to see, changed my way of thinking when designing something new.
