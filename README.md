  3 Install dependencies with `npm install`
  3. Give the command `npm run dev`
  4. navigate to localhost:3000
  
  ## Design goal
  Larissa currently uses 2 schema's for her planning. 
  The yearly and week schema, both are very confusing even with sight.
  Screenreaders are not great reading those kind of documents so Larissa needs someone to help her understand these schema's.
  My goal is to make a website that she alone can use to see her schema's. 
  
  ## My solution
  I learned that Larissa likes to skip unnecessary content and go straight to headers/links.
  I've made the website so that you have specific headers with relevant content beneath them, this way Larissa can quickly go          trough the website and find what she is looking for. 
  The website asks a few question to get the content she wants, like what month? And what activity in this month? Then it shows the details she needs. Concluding from tests done with the prototype she likes the flow and headers.
