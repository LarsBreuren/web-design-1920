# Web Design @cmda-minor-web 1920

## Who is the person i'am designing for?
It's Larissa, she won several medals with cycling on the olympics. 
she is blind and uses screenreaders (JAWS) to navigate trough the web and communicate online.
She loves to horseride, read alot of books and laugh.
She is capable of using her phone and/or laptop to view data for her schedule. 
The scheme itself however is very user unfriendly to use even when you're not blind.

## First test
No tests done yet, however we discussed some things that might be of interest when designing a website for her.
The NS website is a good example of a usable website for her. And she would like to see more details in the schedule when filtering.

## Test 15-4
Made a list with questions.
order of tests made + live links included.
Very diverse concepts from everyone.

Conclusion test:
- Prototype is easy to scan, Larissa can quickly skip through the text -> is fine.
- Radio buttons for months selection work ok, but a dropdown would be better because she can type to navigate (faster).
- Handy that you can navigate with arrow keys and tabs trough the scedule details
- After a few visits, she remembers how a site works (number of tabs).
- Concrete clear headers are very nice, so I have to revise headers.
- Nice that the background is dark, Larissa is sensitive to light.
- Question-steps system to get to details works nice and is creative.
- Larisse is a fan of tabbing, so optimize the site for this


##  Adjustments after test 15-4
- Every time home is visited, Larissa receives a different greeting, which makes it less monotonous.
- Radio buttons has now become a dropdown.
- Headers shorter (and it should still be clear).
- Tabben tested, works good.
- Made a script with JS that randomizes activities so that it changes (as if days pass).
- Values are now passed as Larissa walks through the steps, making it less confusing.
