# Web Design @cmda-minor-web 1920

## Who is the person i'am designing for?
It's Larissa, she won several medals with cycling on the olympics. 
she is blind and uses screenreaders (JAWS) to navigate trough the web and communicate online.
She loves to horseride, read alot of books and laugh.
She is capable of using her phone and/or laptop to view data for her schedule. 
The scheme itself however is very user unfriendly to use even when you're not blind.


# Exclusive design principles on this project

## Study situation

## Igore conventions
I was given the advice not to go to google and search "How to make a website for blind people". 
This would give me a checklist that would maybe improve things a little bit (mostly code stuff) but not how to improve a website for Larissa. This is also a little bit combined with prioritse identity because i carefully listened how Larissa goes trough webpages to find the content she needs

## Prioritise identity

## Add nonsense
